 * lean_controllers.c - see lean_controllers.h for why this file exists and for the
 *                      "IT EXISTS TWICE, KEEP THE TWO COPIES IDENTICAL" rule.
 *
 * STAGES
 * The engine function runs first on both sides; we only post-process its buffer:
 *
 *   engine BG_Player_DoControllersInternal   ->  "pre"
 *   lc_apply(): lateral top-up, then the back-bone reprojection   ->  "post"
 *   client only: apply_ctrl_smooth() temporal filter              ->  "smooth"
 *
 * The third stage has no server counterpart and this file deliberately does NOT own it:
 * it is a display filter with per-client history and a per-frame velocity clamp, so it is
 * not a pure function of the state the server has. It is the one client-only stage left
 * after this file lands, and it is why lc_dump() is exported - dumping "smooth" next to
 * "post" is what will show whether it moves the drawn pose away from the tested one, or
 * whether it converges as intended when the player holds a lean still.
 *
 * MEASUREMENT PROTOCOL this instrumentation is built for
 *   Two clients. One stands still, full lean left, does not move. The other watches.
 *   Both sides dump the same client_num in the same pose; diff the "post" lines field by
 *   field. Repeat crouched. The fields that differ are the answer - and if the IN line
 *   differs too, the divergence is UPSTREAM of this buffer (see the swing_fix note below)
 *   and no amount of tuning down here can close it.
